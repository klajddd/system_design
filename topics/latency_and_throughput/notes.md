# Latency and Throughput

## What are Latency and Throughput?

Latency and throughput are two fundamental performance metrics in system design that measure different aspects of system performance.

### Latency

- Time taken to complete a single operation
- Measured in milliseconds (ms) or microseconds (Î¼s)
- Also known as response time
- Critical for real-time systems

### Throughput

- Number of operations completed per unit time
- Measured in operations per second (ops/sec)
- Also known as bandwidth or capacity
- Critical for batch processing systems

## Key Concepts

### 1. Latency Components

- Network latency
- Processing latency
- Disk I/O latency
- Database query latency
- Cache access latency

### 2. Throughput Components

- CPU processing power
- Network bandwidth
- Disk I/O capacity
- Memory bandwidth
- Database connection pool size

## Performance Metrics

### 1. Response Time Percentiles

- P50 (median)
- P90
- P95
- P99
- P99.9

### 2. Throughput Metrics

- Requests per second (RPS)
- Transactions per second (TPS)
- Queries per second (QPS)
- Bandwidth (bytes/second)

## Optimization Techniques

### 1. Latency Optimization

- Caching
- Load balancing
- CDN usage
- Database optimization
- Connection pooling
- Asynchronous processing

### 2. Throughput Optimization

- Horizontal scaling
- Vertical scaling
- Batch processing
- Connection pooling
- Resource pooling
- Parallel processing

## Common Patterns

### 1. Caching Strategies

```
[Request] --> [Cache Check] --> [Cache Hit] --> [Response]
                    |
                    v
                [Cache Miss] --> [Database] --> [Update Cache] --> [Response]
```

### 2. Load Balancing

```
[Client] --> [Load Balancer] --> [Server 1]
                    |
                    +--> [Server 2]
                    |
                    +--> [Server 3]
```

### 3. Connection Pooling

```
[Application] --> [Connection Pool] --> [Database]
```

## Performance Testing

### 1. Load Testing

- Simulate expected load
- Measure response times
- Identify bottlenecks
- Determine maximum throughput

### 2. Stress Testing

- Test system limits
- Find breaking points
- Measure recovery time
- Identify failure modes

### 3. Benchmarking

- Compare against baselines
- Track improvements
- Set performance goals
- Monitor regressions

## Best Practices

### 1. Monitoring

- Real-time metrics
- Alert thresholds
- Performance dashboards
- Trend analysis

### 2. Optimization

- Regular performance reviews
- Bottleneck identification
- Incremental improvements
- A/B testing

### 3. Capacity Planning

- Growth projections
- Resource requirements
- Scaling strategies
- Cost optimization

## Common Challenges

### 1. Network Issues

- High latency
- Packet loss
- Bandwidth limitations
- Network congestion

### 2. Resource Contention

- CPU bottlenecks
- Memory pressure
- Disk I/O limits
- Network saturation

### 3. Scaling Issues

- Vertical scaling limits
- Horizontal scaling complexity
- Cost implications
- Operational overhead
