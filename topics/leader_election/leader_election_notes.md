# Leader Election

## What is Leader Election?

Leader election is a process in distributed systems where nodes select a single node to act as the leader or coordinator. The leader is responsible for making decisions and coordinating actions across the distributed system.

## Leader Election Algorithms

### 1. Bully Algorithm

- Node with highest ID becomes leader
- Simple implementation
- Handles node failures
- High message complexity

### 2. Ring Algorithm

- Nodes arranged in logical ring
- Election message passed around
- Lower message complexity
- Handles node failures

### 3. Paxos Algorithm

- Consensus-based election
- Handles network partitions
- Strong consistency
- Complex implementation

## Implementation Examples

### 1. ZooKeeper Leader Election

```java
// Create election node
String electionPath = "/election";
zk.create(electionPath + "/node_",
          new byte[0],
          ZooDefs.Ids.OPEN_ACL_UNSAFE,
          CreateMode.EPHEMERAL_SEQUENTIAL);

// Watch for leader changes
List<String> children = zk.getChildren(electionPath, true);
String leader = Collections.min(children);
```

### 2. etcd Leader Election

```go
// Create election session
session, err := concurrency.NewSession(client)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer session.Close()

// Create election
election := concurrency.NewElection(session, "/leader")
err = election.Campaign(context.Background(), "node1")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

## Leader Responsibilities

### 1. Coordination

- Task distribution
- Resource allocation
- State management
- Conflict resolution

### 2. Decision Making

- Configuration changes
- System updates
- Failure handling
- Load balancing

### 3. Monitoring

- Health checks
- Performance monitoring
- Resource usage
- System state

## Failure Handling

### 1. Leader Failure

- Detection mechanisms
- Election process
- State transfer
- Recovery procedures

### 2. Network Partitions

- Split-brain detection
- Partition handling
- Consistency maintenance
- Recovery strategies

### 3. Node Failures

- Failure detection
- Role reassignment
- State recovery
- System stability

## Best Practices

### 1. Design

- Choose appropriate algorithm
- Handle failures
- Maintain consistency
- Consider scalability

### 2. Implementation

- Robust error handling
- Proper logging
- State management
- Recovery procedures

### 3. Operations

- Monitoring
