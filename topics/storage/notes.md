# Storage Systems

## What is Storage?

Storage refers to the systems and technologies used to store, manage, and retrieve data in computing systems. It's a fundamental component of any system design, affecting performance, reliability, and scalability.

## Types of Storage

### 1. Primary Storage (Memory)

- RAM (Random Access Memory)
- Cache Memory
- Characteristics:
  - Fast access
  - Volatile
  - Limited capacity
  - Expensive

### 2. Secondary Storage

- Hard Disk Drives (HDD)
- Solid State Drives (SSD)
- Characteristics:
  - Persistent
  - Larger capacity
  - Slower than primary storage
  - More cost-effective

### 3. Tertiary Storage

- Tape Drives
- Optical Storage
- Characteristics:
  - Very large capacity
  - Slow access
  - Used for backup/archival
  - Cost-effective for large data

## Storage Architectures

### 1. Direct Attached Storage (DAS)

- Storage directly connected to server
- Simple setup
- Limited scalability
- Good for small systems

### 2. Network Attached Storage (NAS)

- File-level storage over network
- Easy to manage
- Good for file sharing
- Moderate scalability

### 3. Storage Area Network (SAN)

- Block-level storage over network
- High performance
- Complex setup
- Excellent scalability

## Database Storage

### 1. Relational Databases

- Structured data
- ACID properties
- Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL
- Use cases:
  - Transactional data
  - Complex queries
  - Data integrity

### 2. NoSQL Databases

- Flexible schema
- Horizontal scaling
- Types:
  - Document (MongoDB)
  - Key-Value (Redis)
  - Column-family (Cassandra)
  - Graph (Neo4j)

### 3. NewSQL Databases

- Combines SQL and NoSQL features
- Distributed architecture
- ACID compliance
- Examples: CockroachDB, TiDB

## Distributed Storage

### 1. Distributed File Systems

- HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)
- GFS (Google File System)
- Features:
  - Fault tolerance
  - Scalability
  - Data replication

### 2. Object Storage

- S3, Google Cloud Storage
- Characteristics:
  - Flat structure
  - REST API
  - High durability
  - Good for static content

### 3. Block Storage

- EBS, Google Persistent Disk
- Characteristics:
  - Raw storage
  - Low latency
  - Good for databases

## Storage Considerations

### 1. Performance

- IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)
- Throughput
- Latency
- Bandwidth

### 2. Reliability

- Data redundancy
- Error detection
- Backup strategies
- Disaster recovery

### 3. Scalability

- Vertical scaling
- Horizontal scaling
- Sharding
- Partitioning

## Storage Patterns

### 1. Caching

- Memory caching
- Disk caching
- Distributed caching
- Cache invalidation

### 2. Replication

- Master-Slave
- Multi-Master
- Synchronous vs Asynchronous
- Conflict resolution

### 3. Sharding

- Horizontal partitioning
- Vertical partitioning
- Shard key selection
- Rebalancing

## Best Practices

### 1. Data Organization

- Proper indexing
- Efficient queries
- Data normalization
- Archival strategies

### 2. Backup and Recovery

- Regular backups
- Point-in-time recovery
- Geographic distribution
- Testing recovery procedures

### 3. Security

- Encryption at rest
- Encryption in transit
- Access control
- Audit logging

## Common Challenges

### 1. Data Growth

- Storage capacity planning
- Data lifecycle management
- Archival strategies
- Cost optimization

### 2. Performance Issues

- IO bottlenecks
- Network latency
- Resource contention
- Query optimization

### 3. Data Consistency

- CAP theorem trade-offs
- Eventual consistency
- Strong consistency
- Conflict resolution
