# Availability

## What is Availability?

Availability refers to the ability of a system to remain operational and accessible when needed. It's typically measured as a percentage of uptime over a given period, with "five nines" (99.999%) being a common target for high-availability systems.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Availability Metrics

- Uptime percentage
- Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
- Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR)
- Service Level Agreements (SLA)

### 2. High Availability Levels

- 99% (3.65 days downtime/year)
- 99.9% (8.76 hours downtime/year)
- 99.99% (52.56 minutes downtime/year)
- 99.999% (5.26 minutes downtime/year)

## High Availability Patterns

### 1. Redundancy

- Active-Active
- Active-Passive
- N+1 redundancy
- Geographic redundancy

### 2. Failover

- Automatic failover
- Manual failover
- Failover testing
- Failover automation

### 3. Load Balancing

- Round-robin
- Least connections
- Weighted distribution
- Health checks

## Disaster Recovery

### 1. Backup Strategies

- Full backups
- Incremental backups
- Differential backups
- Point-in-time recovery

### 2. Recovery Procedures

- Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
- Disaster recovery plan
- Recovery testing

### 3. Data Replication

- Synchronous replication
- Asynchronous replication
- Multi-region replication
- Conflict resolution

## Fault Tolerance

### 1. Circuit Breakers

```
[Service A] --> [Circuit Breaker] --> [Service B]
                    |
                    v
                [Fallback]
```

### 2. Retry Mechanisms

- Exponential backoff
- Jitter
- Maximum retries
- Timeout handling

### 3. Bulkheads

- Service isolation
- Resource limits
- Failure containment
- Graceful degradation

## Monitoring and Alerting

### 1. Health Checks

- Liveness probes
- Readiness probes
- Dependency checks
- Custom health endpoints

### 2. Alerting

- Alert thresholds
- Alert routing
- On-call rotation
- Incident response

### 3. Metrics

- System metrics
- Business metrics
- Custom metrics
- Trend analysis

## Best Practices

### 1. Design Principles

- Design for failure
- Assume nothing is reliable
- Implement graceful degradation
- Use timeouts and retries

### 2. Testing

- Chaos engineering
- Failure injection
- Load testing
- Recovery testing

### 3. Documentation

- Runbooks
- Incident response plans
- Recovery procedures
- Contact information

## Common Challenges

### 1. Network Issues

- Network partitions
- Latency spikes
- Bandwidth limitations
- DNS issues

### 2. Resource Exhaustion

- Memory leaks
- CPU saturation
- Disk space
- Connection limits

### 3. Human Error

- Configuration mistakes
- Deployment errors
- Operational mistakes
- Security incidents
